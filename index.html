    <h3>Thank you for visiting Grey's Online</h3>
    <p>More people are reading Grey's News than ever but advertising revenues across the media are falling fast. And unlike many news organisations, we haven’t put up a paywall – we want to keep our journalism as open as we can. So you can see why we need to ask for your help. Grey's independent, investigative journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe our perspective matters – because it might well be your perspective, too.<br>If everyone who reads our reporting, who likes it, helps fund it, our future would be much more secure. For as little as $1, you can support Grey's – and it only takes a minute. Thank you.</p>
